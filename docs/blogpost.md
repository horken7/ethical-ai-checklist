# Ethical AI Checklist

## Why is this needed?
* We need to raise *awareness* about AI *ethics* and *fairness* on a global level
* We need *transparency*, *equality*, and *diversity* in AI
* But we need to get more *practical* and *concrete* in this discussion
* Saying "think about ethics and fairness" is *not enough*

## The Checklist

### 1. Have you sat down and thought about which bias your model may exhibit and which effects that may have, and done your best to mitigate unethical effects?

### 2. Have you evaluated your training data for (statistical) unethical bias?
tbd

### 3. Upon discovering bias, have you not compromised ethicality in favor of model performance?
tbd

### 4. Have you sat down and thought about edge cases and their impact as well as tested them on the model to the best of your ability?
tbd

### 5. Have you discussed the model and its training data with a peer in another demographic? (e.g. not white middle-aged man)
tbd

### 6. Have you discussed the model impact and tested the output on your target audience?
tbd

### 7. After deploying/publishing, are you continuously monitoring performance to identify unethical behavior?
tbd

### Upon answering yes to all of these questions, do you feel that you have done your best with your current knowledge and abilities to make this model ethical?
No one can do everything, but everyone can do something.

Do this for every project to the best of your abilities. Lightweight enough for a sparetime coder to do in an evening, but extensive enough for a big company to recruit an entire department for.

## AI Best Practices
When thinking about each of these points individually and removing the word "ethical", most of the points still provide value from a pure AI perspective. You should test your model on edge cases, clean your data, test on users, and continuously monitor performance - that is part of AI best practice. If we just extend the existing best practises to also include "ethical" then we have taken a step in the right direction.

## What is Ethical or Fair?
This checklist does not make any assumptions on what is ethical or fair, that has to be up to the individual. It rather provides a framework to use as basis to think about these kind of questions
