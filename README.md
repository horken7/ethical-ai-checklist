# Ethical AI Checklist
A checklist to go through when designing ethical AI models

This checklist intends to democratise the development of ethical AI. The usage of this checklist should always be to the best of ones abilities. This checklist does not impose any value on what is "ethical" or "fair", that must always be up to the individual. The intention of this checklist is to be short but comprehensive, and will never exceed 10 points. 

## The List

1. Have you sat down and thought about which bias your model may exhibit and which effects that may have, and done your best to mitigate unethical effects?
2. Have you evaluated your training data for (statistical) unethical bias?
3. Upon discovering bias, have you not compromised ethicality in favor of model performance?
4. Have you sat down and thought about edge cases and their impact as well as tested them on the model to the best of your ability?
5. Have you discussed the model and its training data with a peer in another demographic? (e.g. not white middle-aged man)
6. Have you discussed the model impact and tested the output on your target audience?
7. After deploying/publishing, are you continuously monitoring performance to identify unethical behavior?

----

Upon answering yes to all of these questions, do you feel that you have done your best with your current knowledge and abilities to make this model ethical?

If yes, then proceed.
